As introduction to our system, based on MongoDB, the data collections we have is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>supporters (can&rsquo;t be disclosed, contains authentication token)</li>
<li>htmls (raw htmls received by browser extension)</li>
<li>metadata (the actual parsed information):
<ul>
<li>metadata of type &lsquo;video&rsquo; have tags, categories and the 8 related content</li>
<li>metadata type &lsquo;home&rsquo; have the five sections and the video display</li>
<li>metadata type &lsquo;recommented&rsquo; has a sequence of videos recomended by pornhub guesses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gross entries count (which might also be collected when the test was over, and we have to decide if consider them or not):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; db.getCollection('htmls').count({href: &quot;https://www.pornhub.com/&quot;, savingTime: { $gte: new Date(&quot;2020-01-19&quot;) }})
1027
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; db.getCollection('htmls').count({href: &quot;https://www.pornhub.com/recommended/&quot;, savingTime: { $gte: new Date(&quot;2020-01-19&quot;) }})
1031
</code></pre><p>The html saved are heavily duplicated: an observation might send up to 5 time the same html, which will contribute to the same metadataId. This is why we&rsquo;ve to look at the unique number of publicKey (which is the user identifier)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>db.getCollection('htmls').distinct('publicKey', {href: &quot;https://www.pornhub.com/recommended&quot;, savingTime: { $gte: new Date(&quot;2020-01-19&quot;) }})
</code></pre><p>89 elements. Maybe not all the participants followed the script correctly, and perhaps our parser did not work in all the possible scenarios, but as a generic indication, we gathered 89 individual observations in our first test.</p>
<p>Is it bad or good? It is, of course, good news. It is representative? Of course it isn&rsquo;t. Thankfully, it doesn&rsquo;t matter yet since our first goal is to test out team, the tool, and start to measure the divergence between similar PH experiences.</p>
<h2 id="update-n3----21-january-2020">Update n.3 &ndash; 21 January 2020</h2>
<p>The <em>recommended</em> parser is supported now! each video suggested will be extracted with the following dataformat:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>   {
     &quot;order&quot;: 2,                                             
     &quot;duration&quot;: &quot;35:55&quot;,                                    
     &quot;publicationRelative&quot;: &quot;2 months ago&quot;,                  
     &quot;views&quot;: &quot;4.3M&quot;,                                        
     &quot;viewString&quot;: &quot;4.3M views&quot;,                             
     &quot;title&quot;: null,                                          
     &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5d6b197f4129b&quot;,

     &quot;authorName&quot;: &quot;Nyna Ferragni&quot;

   }    
</code></pre><p>The above json object is the second video snippet from a recommended page, now we will produce and share the final CSV as part of this experiment.</p>
<p>&hellip;In regards of the Chrome extension, it seems definitely blocked at the moment:</p>

<p>whatever, just a reason to consider firefox <strong>better</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="update-n2----20-january-2020">Update n.2 &ndash; 20 January 2020</h2>
<p>Despite Google didn&rsquo;t enable our extention, a bunch of Firefox adopters supported our project:</p>

<h2 id="update-n1----19-january-2020">Update n.1 &ndash; 19 January 2020</h2>
<p>This test will work only with our <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adult-industry-algorithms/">firefox extension</a>, because Google has put our extension under <em>revision</em>, and therefore it is not accessible to the public:</p>

<h2 id="announcement-----19-january-2020">Announcement  &ndash; 19 January 2020</h2>
<p>On Sunday, January 19th, 2020: join the first collective observation of the #pornhub algorithm!</p>
<p>We are the tracking.exposed team and our main objective is to put a spotlight on usersâ€™ tracking, profiling, and the wider data market by performing an open algorithmic analysis. We believe that, as long as the operation of recommendation systems remains obscure, the many side-effects of platform economy cannot be tackled as they should.</p>
<p>After the development of the infrastructure and analysis tools facebook.tracking.exposed and youtube.tracking.exposed, we decided to take inspiration from the 34th rule of the internet: There is porn of it. No exceptions.</p>
<p>So, are now also focusing on online porn giant PornHub, trying to unpack the hidden logic of user profiling!</p>
<p>We do it because personalization algorithms have the potential to shape public perception, and Pornhub claims to implement some kind of personalization!</p>
<p>To do this, we need your help! Join our global test and explore for yourself how the Pornhub experience varies between users that are performing the same actions. You have to follow an 8 step script. (hard work for a Sunday!)
After the test is completed and the evidence analyzed, we will release the dataset, along with some research and a final report, around January 30th, 2020.</p>
<p>You can find our browser extension on the pornhub.tracking.exposed website: it is necessary to participate, and collects what Pornhub send to you. Partecipation is anonymous, the extension can be used in Incognito/Private mode if you allow it, and for extra safety, you can even do the test with a browser you normally do not use (the extension runs in both Firefox and Chrome).</p>
<p>The test is simple â€” just follow the script you&rsquo;ll find at this address: <a href="https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/1">https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/1</a>. All you have to do is to click on a few links, and we&rsquo;ll do the rest: by comparing multiple observations coming from our participants, we&rsquo;ll measure how frequently personalized changes happen.</p>
<p>The test is not safe for work! We kindly ask you to watch the two videos that we selected after months of exhausting research, but if you don&rsquo;t like them, don&rsquo;t worry! Twenty seconds are enough for the extension to collect data and send it back to us. Of course, you retain full control of the evidence you send to us: by clicking on the extension icon, you can open your personal page, where you can eventually delete everything you sent us or play with our basic data analysis functionality.</p>
<p>Thank you,
The pornhub.tracking.exposed team</p>
