      <description>After our global-call on the 19th of January, we are glad to follow-up and say that:
 The test on the PornHub&amp;rsquo;s algorithm went well enough. More than 100+ supporters showed up. /impact. This is not enough to be representative, but it is a good start to test our process. We collected 87 correct sequences (see at methodology section our selection logic). We released the software and documented the data format: we&amp;rsquo;ll repeat the experiment soon.</description>

      <description>Final update! This is the final report, this the presentation summary. Follow the second collaborative observation!
Bug report &amp;ndash; weakness in our dataset, and lesson learn before the next time!  In { type: &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; }, sections might contain &amp;lsquo;null&amp;rsquo; and this is a parsing bug. Few authorLink and authorName might miss. This is either a parsing bug and a logical bug. It might happens for video taken down by PornHub, or few video preview do not display their author, or not every video has a publisher because it can simply display do be of &amp;lsquo;Pornhub&amp;rsquo;.</description>
