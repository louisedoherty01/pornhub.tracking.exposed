      <description>2020 Insights are still missing, 5 things you should consider   1) The bait called Amateur  â€” By giving space to independent creators, PornHub redirects users&#39; attention to sell their own products. On the average homepage two products are pushed: the dying porn industry (which mostly is owned by the same company that owns pornhub, Mindgeek), and professionals/amateurs who want to sell their product directly, as long as PH intermediates.</description>

      <description>After our global-call on the 19th of January, we are glad to follow-up and say that:
 The test on the PornHub&amp;rsquo;s algorithm went well enough. More than 100+ supporters showed up. /impact. This is not enough to be representative, but it is a good start to test our process. We collected 87 correct sequences (see at methodology section our selection logic). We released the software and documented the data format: we&amp;rsquo;ll repeat the experiment soon.</description>

Bug report &amp;ndash; weakness in our dataset, and lesson learn before the next time!  In { type: &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; }, sections might contain &amp;lsquo;null&amp;rsquo; and this is a parsing bug. Few authorLink and authorName might miss. This is either a parsing bug and a logical bug. It might happens for video taken down by PornHub, or few video preview do not display their author, or not every video has a publisher because it can simply display do be of &amp;lsquo;Pornhub&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Since January 2019 we conducted a little set of experiments on Pornhub. The tool we built to analyze Youtube Algorithm, was a good starting point to analyze the platform since they are both Tube Sites, streaming audiovisual content.  Ideas for researchers Researchers can use the tool to understand and show where and how Pornhub personalization algorithm works, to identify metrics able to influence it, and to carry out higher level researches, for instance about the sociologic impact on sexuality.</description>

 for Firefox browser â€” which we suggest!  
 for Chrome, Brave, and Edge.   POV   Homemade pornography has been made possible by the technological advances of cameras, video cameras and mobile phones, but itâ€™s the web that has allowed its distribution in an endemic way. The World Wide Web was the first computer technology that as main component of its value proposition had the mainstream adoption of pornography.</description>

The points on the rays are joined with segments, so that the graph takes on a personal shape. This shape can tell us something about user profiling, radicalization and which are the categories most connected to each other.</description>

 Project introduction pornhub.tracking.exposed (poTREX) saves the suggested videos to different Pornhub users as evidence, in order to allow us to study and visualize how these change over time, or by geographical area, or per user, as well as the mechanics that make it different compared to other media and social networks. Because PornHub is behaving in a quasi-monopolism fashion, we should acknowledge the large impact it can have in shaping the perception of pornography, in the same way, we feel concerned about YouTube personalization algorithm.</description>
